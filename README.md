# Traffic Accident Injury Database

Group project for Computer Science class INF442 at École Polytechnique, developed with Alicia Fortes Machado.

Our main object is to analyse a database that contains all traffics accidents in France, provided by the French government, 
and give a recommendation to decrease the number of accidents using algorithms which have been learned in class.
